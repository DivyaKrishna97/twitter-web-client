# Twitter Web Client

A basic clone of a user's Twitter home timeline page. The features implemented
are:

* authenticate against Twitter
* viewing timeline, loading older tweets/statuses manually (i.e. no autoload on
scroll)
* posting a status update with attachment and location
* basic polling for new tweets/statuses on the timeline (this does not use the
streaming API, so it can and will hit the REST API rate limit)

Implemented with Scala and Play Framework 2.2.

## Configuration

Environment variables to set up:

* `APPLICATION_SECRET` to set the `application.secret` value
* `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`
* `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`

You will need to create a new application at: https://dev.twitter.com/apps
The settings to use under `Application Type` are:

* Read and Write access
* http://host:port/authenticate/twitter for the callback URL
* Tick `Allow this application to be used to Sign in with Twitter`

## Running on a development environment

I assume you are running a Unix-like OS and already have a Scala and Play
Framework 2.2+ environment configured.

1. Export the environment variables, eg. `$ export APPLICATION_SECRET=blah`
2. `$ play run`
3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:9000/
